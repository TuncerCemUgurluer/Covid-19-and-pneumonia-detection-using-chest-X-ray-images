# Project Description
This project aims to develop a COVID-19 and pneumonia detection system using chest X-ray images. The system leverages deep learning techniques to classify X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. By accurately identifying these conditions from X-ray images, the system can assist medical professionals in diagnosing respiratory diseases efficiently.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: The system classifies chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19, using a deep learning model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: X-ray images are preprocessed and augmented to enhance the robustness and generalization of the model.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and classification reports.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualization of training and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance and provide insights into its behavior.

## Code Structure and Usage
The codebase consists of several components:

1. **Data Preparation**: X-ray images are downloaded from a Kaggle dataset and preprocessed for training and testing.
2. **Model Building**: A deep learning model based on the Xception architecture is constructed for image classification. The model includes layers for feature extraction, global average pooling, dropout regularization, batch normalization, and a dense output layer for classification.
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the training dataset using data augmentation techniques to improve performance and generalization.
4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the validation and test datasets to assess its accuracy and performance in classifying X-ray images.
5. **Visualization**: Training and evaluation metrics such as loss and accuracy are visualized using plots to analyze the model's behavior and performance over epochs.
